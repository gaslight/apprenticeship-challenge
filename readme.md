Gaslight Apprenticeship Challenge Application 
===========================

Notes: 
--------------

If you are encountering errors after updating the existing files, delete everything and install it again. I changed package.json so it will download express-react-views instead of trying to use a local version.

Libraries used
--------------
express-react-views: Easily use Express, Node, and React together 

node-mysql: For connecting to MySQL database

react-bootstrap: Bootstrap for React

express-sessions: Simple session middleware for Express

Run it
------
    npm install babelify
    npm install request
    npm install browserify
    npm install express
    npm install react
    npm install react-dom
    npm install passport 
    npm install mysql 
    npm install passport-local
    npm install express-session
    npm install react-bootstrap
    npm install body-parser
    npm install
    npm run start

    *Make sure MySQL is running as well*

    http://localhost:3000
